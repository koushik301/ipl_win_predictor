Welcome to the IPL Win Predictor! This project uses a **Logistic Regression** model to forecast the win probability of a chasing team in a live IPL match. Turn raw data into game-changing insights!

## About This Project

The IPL Win Predictor is a machine learning tool designed to calculate the real-time probability of an IPL match outcome. By analyzing crucial in-game metrics like the required run rate, balls remaining, and wickets in hand, the model provides a percentage chance of victory for the batting team.

### Features

* **Live Win Probability:** Get instant predictions on which team is more likely to win.
* **Interactive Controls:** A clean and simple UI built with Streamlit allows you to input match scenarios easily.
* **Data-Driven Insights:** Understand how the game state influences the outcome based on historical match data.
* **Fully Deployed:** Hosted on Streamlit Cloud for public access without any local setup.

## How to Use

To get a prediction, you need to input the current state of the second innings:

* **Batting Team:** The team that is currently chasing the target.
* **Bowling Team:** The team that is defending the target.
* **Venue/City:** The city where the match is being played.
* **Target:** The total runs the batting team needs to score to win.
* **Score:** The current score of the batting team.
* **Overs Completed:** The number of overs the batting team has faced.
* **Wickets Out:** The number of wickets the batting team has lost.

The model will process these inputs and display the win probability for both teams.

## Tech Stack

This project is built using the following open-source technologies:

* **Python:** The core programming language for model development.
* **pandas & NumPy:** For efficient data manipulation and numerical operations.
* **Scikit-learn:** For building and training the Logistic Regression model.
* **Streamlit:** To create and deploy the interactive web application.
